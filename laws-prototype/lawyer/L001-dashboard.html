							<small>Dear all, I just looked in on the Philadelphia
								court system concerning the qualifications of jurors. As it
								happens, I was called to report to jury duty this past Winter,
								and was questioned by a judge (chiefly because I reject the
								death penalty). In any case, not responding to a call to jury
								duty is a punishable offense under Pennsylvania law. So, I did
								my duty, I showed up, and I was qualified to serve. The judge,
								and both the prosecutor and the defense lawyer can object to
								particular possible jurors and keep them from being empaneled.
								In consequence, the actual trial is proceeded by a process of
								jury selection, in which all parties to the case are present.
								Here is the list of qualifications for members of a jury in
								Philadelphia (where trial by jury has been practiced for
								hundreds of years--since the 17th century, I would think): In
								order to qualify for jury service, you must meet the following
								requirements: You must be able to read, write, and speak the
								English language. You must not have been convicted of a crime
								punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. You must be
								physically and mentally able to perform the functions of a
								juror. You must be a United States citizen at the time you are
								summoned. You must be a Philadelphia resident and at least 18
								years of age. If you are not mentally or physically able to
								serve as a juror, provide medical certification in the remarks
								section of the questionnaire. If you are requesting to be
								excused for a job related reason, your employer should certify
								the hardship in the remarks section.</small>
