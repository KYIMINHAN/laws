								<small> Law is a set of rules decided by a particular
									state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security
									of society. Courts or police may enforce this system of rules
									and punish people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine,
									or other penalty including jail. In ancient societies, laws
									were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can
									live, work and do business with each other. But many times in
									history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at
									the expense of society, they have resulted in conflict. To
									prevent this, in most countries today, laws are written and
									voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a
									parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed
									peoples. Countries today have a constitution for the overall
									framework of society and make further laws as needed for
									matters of detail. Members of society generally have enough
									freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do. An
									activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the
									laws. A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced.
									This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments.
									A lawyer, jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and
									argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two
									kinds of attorneys - "transcriptional" attorneys who write
									contracts and "litigators" who go to court. In the United
									Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and
									barristers respectively. The Rule of Law is the law which says
									that government can only legally use its power in a way the
									government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a
									government has, as agreed in a country's constitution. The Rule
									of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the
									people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on
									themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of
									law being followed. "The rule of law", wrote the ancient Greek
									philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, "is better than the rule of
									any individual." Culture is usually a major source of the
									principles behind many laws, and people also tend to trust the
									ideas based on family and social habits. In many countries
									throughout history, religion and religious books like the
									Vedas, Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law. </small>
