						<small>Dear all, I just looked in on the Philadelphia
							court system concerning the qualifications of jurors. As it
							happens, I was called to report to jury duty this past Winter,
							and was questioned by a judge (chiefly because I reject the death
							penalty). In any case, not responding to a call to jury duty is a
							punishable offense under Pennsylvania law. So, I did my duty, I
							showed up, and I was qualified to serve. The judge, and both the
							prosecutor and the defense lawyer can object to particular
							possible jurors and keep them from being empaneled. In
							consequence, the actual trial is proceeded by a process of jury
							selection, in which all parties to the case are present. Here is
							the list of qualifications for members of a jury in Philadelphia
							(where trial by jury has been practiced for hundreds of
							years--since the 17th century, I would think): In order to
							qualify for jury service, you must meet the following
							requirements: You must be able to read, write, and speak the
							English language. You must not have been convicted of a crime
							punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. You must be
							physically and mentally able to perform the functions of a juror.
							You must be a United States citizen at the time you are summoned.
							You must be a Philadelphia resident and at least 18 years of age.
							If you are not mentally or physically able to serve as a juror,
							provide medical certification in the remarks section of the
							questionnaire. If you are requesting to be excused for a job
							related reason, your employer should certify the hardship in the
							remarks section.</small>

								<small>I wonder about the argument apparently made
									against the use of the jury. Various countries have differing
									traditions, and may be more or less democratic; but in any
									case, India apparently used to make wider use of trial by jury,
									according to your account of the matter. When did this change?
									Is it a quite recent change, or did it take place some decades
									back? In the usual case, the judge is charged with instructing
									the jury about the law, so that their initial possible
									ignorance of the law is attended to in that way.<a

								<small>In 2004, the Law School of my University had the
									privilege of receiving the visit of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the
									oldest US Supreme Court Justice in office right now, and a
									splendid human being who is quite knowledgeable of literature
									and the fine arts. We had lunch under a beautiful tent in the
									interior patio of one of the oldest buildings in Old San Juan
									amidst the first Triennial of Puerto Rican and Caribbean Art,
									an international affair Ginsburg walked through with much joy
									and quite a lot of comments. </small>
